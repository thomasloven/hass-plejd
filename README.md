# Plejd integration for Home Assistant

Connects to your [Plejd](https://www.plejd.com) devices using your Home Assistant Bluetooth.

This integration requires a [Bluetooth](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/) adapter which supports at least one Active connections.

Using an [EspHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth) is recommended, but Shelly proxies will not work.
If you make your own esphome configuration, make sure the [`bluetooth_proxy`](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy) has `active` set to `True`.

## Installation for testing

- Make sure you have a working Bluetooth integration in Home Assistant (a bluetooth proxy should work too)
- Make sure you have no other plejd custom components or add-ons running.
- Install the integration:

  - Either: Download the `plejd` directory and place in your `<config>/custom_components`.
  - Or: Add this repo (`thomasloven/hass_plejd`) as a custom repository in HACS, add the integration from HACS

- Restart Home Assistant
- Hopefully, your Plejd mesh will be auto discovered and you should see a message popping up in your integrations page.
- Log in with the credentials you use in the Plejd app when prompted (email address and password)

> Note: I will not have this added to the HACS default repository. My hope is to have it added to Home Assistant instead.

## Supported devices

- All known Plejd dimmers and relays should work (except DAL-01).

- All known Plejd lights except OUT-01 should work, but white balance is not supported.

- Pushbutton WPH-01 should work.

  - An event entity will be triggered when each button is pushed

- Rotary dimmer WRT-01 should register and fire events when pushed.

  - Rotations are **not** registered. This is a limitation in how Plejd works. Rotation events are not actually sent to the mesh, but directly to whatever device the WRT-01 is paired to. Therefore it is impossible to listen in on them.

- Plejd Scenes should show up and be triggerable in Home Assistant (unless hidden in the Plejd app).
  - An event entity will be triggered when they are activated (even if hidden in the Plejd app).

## Unsupported devices

- GWY-01 doesn't do anything.

- EXT-01 doesn't do anything

- RTR-01 Is not actually a device but an addition to other devices.

- DAL-01 is not supported, because I don't have access to one.

- OUT-01 is not supported, because it is unreleased, and I don't have access to one.

**If you have a DAL-01 or OUT-01 device, please get in touch to help me get them supported.**

## Other integrations

There area several other integrations for Plejd with Home Assistant available, made by some awesome people.

The following is a list of the ones I have looked at in order to create this one, and how this one is different.

I could not have made this one without their great job in decoding the Plejd cloud API and Bluetooth communication protocol.
